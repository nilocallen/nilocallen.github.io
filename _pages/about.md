Hey there!  I'm a computer science grad from RIT seeking a full-time, remote <br>or Boston stationed
role in software engineering, game creation, computer science research, networking, cyber security, or low-level/embedded systems. 

Although I'm open minded in which roles I'm seeking, I do have a few special interests that I would love to 
professionally explore.  Firstly, I began programming in my teenage years to create games.  I loved my computers and I loved my 
games, and this was the first choice of many that gave me my career today. I came out of this with a cursory understanding of the game engines Unity and Gamemaker Studio, as well as experience creating my own 2d game engine.  

Next, I love tying software to hardware.  This interest first blossomed in 
my high school robotics team, where I was the lead programmer and builder, and taught the newcomers how to
code.  In college, this interest evolved into my newest passion in the industry: low level hardware and 
software.  This began in one of my first 200 level courses, where I learned the inner workings of assembly language 
and CPUs.  The knowledge from this course lead to me messing around with arduinos and circuit simulations.
Lastly, I am especially interested in networking and cybersecurity after my first internship coding
network management software and a course at RIT on networking and data communication.  I love the idea of
creating and defending resilient and secure networks and would love to try my hand as a network engineer or
cyber security agent. 

I also love to be creative, which I channel through music.  My first band in Rochester, who I drummed for, released <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3by7mJaH793EiHkIzPijz4?si=1e1a98d8d0ba4da3" target="_blank">one single</a> before we parted ways.  My time with them was invaluable.  I
improved greatly, and I learned that I want to pursue music for as long as I can.
